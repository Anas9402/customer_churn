# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn based on historical data, helping organizations take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering for improved model performance
- Model training using **Scikit-learn** classifiers
- Performance evaluation with metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- End-to-end pipeline implementation in Python

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Import dataset (customer records with churn labels).
2. **Preprocessing** – Clean and transform data for modeling.
3. **EDA** – Visualize churn patterns and correlations.
4. **Modeling** – Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
5. **Evaluation** – Compare models using classification metrics.
6. **Insights** – Identify key churn drivers for business strategy.

## 🚀 Results
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting churn.
- Identified key factors influencing customer retention (e.g., contract type, tenure, monthly charges).
- Provided actionable insights for reducing churn rates.
